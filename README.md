Visualising point clouds in VR

lasVR is a collaboration between NCI and the [TraitCapture](traitcapture.org) project from ANU node of the Australian Plant Phenomics Facility [(APPF)](http://www.plantphenomics.org.au) and the [Borevitz Lab](http://borevitzlab.anu.edu.au).

LasVR provides an easy to use, drag and drop interface for viewing and interacting with singe and time-series pointclouds of unlimited size on desktop and with the Vive or Oculus. 

We will also be adding tha ability to co-visualize any associated numeric data with the point clouds (i.e. sensor data, object labels, etc.).

You can also very easily generate fly-through movies of the point clouds.
