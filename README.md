Visualising point clouds in VR

lasVR is a collaboration between NCI and the [TraitCapture](traitcapture.org) project from ANU node of the Australian Plant Phenomics Facility [(APPF)](http://www.plantphenomics.org.au) and the [Borevitz Lab](http://borevitzlab.anu.edu.au).

LasVR provides an easy to use, drag and drop interface for viewing and interacting with pointclouds of unlimited size.
