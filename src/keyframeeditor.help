Keyframe Editor allows users to save keyframes for creating animations.

Once saved, keyframes can be moved to change the frame number. Users can overwrite the keyframes. Select a keyframe by clicking on the keyframe image. Once selected, a keyframe can be deleted. 

Srishti interpolates camera parameters between keyframes.
